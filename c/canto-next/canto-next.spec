This is the RSS backend for Canto clients.

Canto is an Atom/RSS feed reader for the console that is meant to be
quick, concise, and colorful. It's meant to allow you to crank through
feeds like you've never cranked before by providing a minimal, yet
information packed interface. No navigating menus. No dense blocks of
unreadable white text. An interface with almost infinite customization
and extensibility using the excellent Python programming language.
