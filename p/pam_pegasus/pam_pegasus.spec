%description
pam_pegasus is a PAM module which may be used with a PAM-aware login
service to provide per-user privately mounted /tmp directory
as a part of PAM session management.

The directory is being mounted with the following mount options:
-t tmpfs -o mode=0700,uid=UID,gid=GID,size=25%

This PAM module was implemented for use in pegasus systems, hence the name.
