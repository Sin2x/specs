%description
dosbox-staging is an attempt to revitalize DOSBox's development process.
It's not a rewrite, but a continuation and improvement on the existing
DOSBox codebase while leveraging modern development tools and practices.

Goals:
- Improve the out-of-the-box experience for new users.
- Encourage new contributors by removing barriers to entry.
- Fix, cleanup, and integrate several notable community-developed
patches that are not included in the SourceForge-hosted project.
- Implement new features and quality-of-life improvements.
- Prioritize DOS gaming, while welcoming general improvements (such as
for productivity software) that don't impact game emulation quality or
code-maintainability.
- Strike a balance between emulation quality, speed, and usability.
- Deliver a consistent cross-platform experience.
- Leverage ongoing DOSBox development.
- Focus on supporting up-to-date, current Operating Systems and modern
hardware.
