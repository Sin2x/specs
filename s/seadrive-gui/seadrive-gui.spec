%description
Seafile Drive client.
Seafile is an open source cloud storage system with features
on privacy protection and teamwork. Collections of files are
called libraries, and each library can be synced separately.
A library can also be encrypted with a user chosen password.
Seafile also allows users to create groups and easily sharing
files into groups.

Note: you need install seadrive-daemon also, which not opensourced.
