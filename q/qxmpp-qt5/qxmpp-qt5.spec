%description
Xmpp is a cross-platform C++ XMPP client and server library. It is written
in C++ and uses Qt framework.

QXmpp strives to be as easy to use as possible, the underlying TCP
socket, the core XMPP RFCs (RFC3920 and RFC3921) and XMPP extensions have
been nicely encapsulated into classes. QXmpp comes with full API
documentation, automatic tests and many examples.

QXmpp is a cross-platform C++ XMPP client library. It is based on Qt and
C++. This package's the fork of QXmpp for Leechcraft Internet Client.

QXmpp is pretty intuitive and easy to use. It uses Qt extensively. Qt
is the only third party library it is dependent on. Users need to a
have working knowledge of C++ and Qt basics (Signals and Slots and Qt
data types). The underlying TCP socket and the XMPP RFCs (RFC3920 and
RFC3921) have been encapsulated into classes and functions. Therefore
the user would not be bothered with these details. But it is always
recommended to the advanced users to read and enjoy the low level
details.

This package contains files needed for development.
