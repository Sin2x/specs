%description
combo is a comprehensive Python toolbox for combining machine learning (ML) models and scores.
Model combination can be considered as a subtask of ensemble learning,
and has been widely used in real-world tasks and data science competitions like Kaggle.
combo has been used/introduced in various research works since its inception [7] [11].

combo library supports the combination of models and score from key ML libraries such as scikit-learn, xgboost, and LightGBM,
for crucial tasks including classification, clustering, anomaly detection.
