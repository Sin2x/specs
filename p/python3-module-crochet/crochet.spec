%description
Crochet is an MIT-licensed library that makes it easier to use Twisted
from regular blocking code. Some use cases include:

* Easily use Twisted from a blocking framework like Django or Flask.
* Write a library that provides a blocking API, but uses Twisted for its
  implementation.
* Port blocking code to Twisted more easily, by keeping a backwards
  compatibility layer.
* Allow normal Twisted programs that use threads to interact with
  Twisted more cleanly from their threaded parts. For example this can
  be useful when using Twisted as a WSGI container.
