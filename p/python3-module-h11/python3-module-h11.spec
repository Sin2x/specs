%description
This is a little HTTP/1.1 library written from scratch in Python,
heavily inspired by hyper-h2.

It's a "bring-your-own-I/O" library; h11 contains no IO code whatsoever.
This means you can hook h11 up to your favorite network API,
and that could be anything you want: synchronous, threaded, asynchronous,
or your own implementation of RFC 6214 -- h11 won't judge you.
