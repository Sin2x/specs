%description
ALGOPY is a tool for Algorithmic Differentiation (AD) and Taylor
polynomial approximations. ALGOPY makes it possible to perform
computations on scalar and polynomial matrices. It is designed to be as
compatible to numpy as possible. I.e. views, broadcasting and most
functions of numpy can be performed on polynomial matrices. Exampels are
dot,trace,qr,solve, inv,eigh. The reverse mode of AD is also supported
by a simple code evaluation tracer.

%changelog
* Thu Apr 02 2020 Andrey Bychkov <mrdrew@altlinux.org> 0.5.3-alt2
- Build for python2 disabled.

* Wed Jan 09 2019 Mikhail Gordeev <obirvalger@altlinux.org> 0.5.3-alt1.git20150630.3
- Fix tests passing. Tests use deprecated module numpy.testing.decorators, very
  likely tests will not pass with next numpy upgrade and tests must be disabled.

* Fri Feb 02 2018 Stanislav Levin <slev@altlinux.org> 0.5.3-alt1.git20150630.2.1
- (NMU) Fix Requires and BuildRequires to python-setuptools

* Thu Aug 03 2017 Aleksei Nikiforov <darktemplar@altlinux.org> 0.5.3-alt1.git20150630.2
- Fixed build.

* Sun Mar 13 2016 Ivan Zakharyaschev <imz@altlinux.org> 0.5.3-alt1.git20150630.1.1
- (NMU) rebuild with rpm-build-python3-0.1.9
  (for common python3/site-packages/ and auto python3.3-ABI dep when needed)

* Thu Jan 28 2016 Mikhail Efremov <sem@altlinux.org> 0.5.3-alt1.git20150630.1
- NMU: Use buildreq for BR.

* Sun Aug 30 2015 Eugeny A. Rostovtsev (REAL) <real at altlinux.org> 0.5.3-alt1.git20150630
- Initial build for Sisyphus
