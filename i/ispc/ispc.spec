%description
ispc is a compiler for a variant of the C programming language, with
extensions for "single program, multiple data" (SPMD) programming. Under the
SPMD model, the programmer writes a program that generally appears to be a
regular serial program, though the execution model is actually that a number
of program instances execute in parallel on the hardware.

ispc compiles a C-based SPMD programming language to run on the SIMD units of
CPUs and the Intel Xeon Phi architecture; it frequently provides a 3x or more
speedup on CPUs with 4-wide vector SSE units and 5x-6x on CPUs with 8-wide AVX
vector units, without any of the difficulty of writing intrinsics code.
Parallelization across multiple cores is also supported by ispc, making it
possible to write programs that achieve performance improvement that scales by
both number of cores and vector unit size.

#	CMake Warning at cmake/LLVMConfig.cmake:105 (message):
#	  LLVM was built without assertions enabled (-DLLVM_ENABLE_ASSERTIONS=OFF).
#	  This disables dumps, which are required for ISPC to be fully functional.
