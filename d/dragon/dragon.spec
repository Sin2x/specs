%description
Many programs, particularly web applications, expect files to be dragged
into them now. If you don't habitually use a file manager that is
a problem. dragon is a lightweight drag-and-drop source for X where you
can run: dragon file.tar.gz to get a window with just that file in it,
ready to be dragged where you need it.
