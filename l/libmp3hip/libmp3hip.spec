BuildPreReq: python-devel

%description
Based off of Michael Hipp's mpglib 0.2a <http://www.mpg123.de/>, with
many improvements by the lame development team (see AUTHORS).

The interface to the library is based off of vorbisfile.  If you add mp3
support to your app using this library it should be a snap to add Ogg
Vorbis support as well.

This isn't as fast as mpg123 will be for decoding as none of it is in
assembler.
