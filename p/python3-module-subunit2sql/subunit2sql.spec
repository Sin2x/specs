%define oname subunit2sql
%define descr \
subunit2SQL is a tool for storing test results data in a SQL database. Like \
it's name implies it was originally designed around converting `subunit`_ \
streams to data in a SQL database and the packaged utilities assume a subunit \
stream as the input format. However, the data model used for the DB does not \
preclude using any test result format. Additionally the analysis tooling built \
on top of a database is data format agnostic. However if you choose to use a \
different result format as an input for the database additional tooling using \
the DB api would need to be created to parse a different test result output \
format. It's also worth pointing out that subunit has several language library \
bindings available. So as a user you could create a small filter to convert a \
different format to subunit. Creating a filter should be fairly easy and then \
you don't have to worry about writing a tool like :ref:`subunit2sql` to use a \
different format.
