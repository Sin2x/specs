%description
PyWavelets is a free Open Source library for wavelet transforms in Python.
Wavelets are mathematical basis functions that are localized in both time
and frequency.
Wavelet transforms are time-frequency transforms employing wavelets.
They are similar to Fourier transforms, the difference being that
Fourier transforms are localized only in frequency instead of in time
and frequency.

The main features of PyWavelets are:
- 1D, 2D and nD Forward and Inverse Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT and IDWT)
- 1D, 2D and nD Multilevel DWT and IDWT
- 1D and 2D Stationary Wavelet Transform (Undecimated Wavelet Transform)
- 1D and 2D Wavelet Packet decomposition and reconstruction
- 1D Continuous Wavelet Tranfsorm
- Computing Approximations of wavelet and scaling functions
- Over 100 built-in wavelet filters and support for custom wavelets
- Single and double precision calculations
- Real and complex calculations
- Results compatible with Matlab Wavelet Toolbox (TM)
