%description
Getting Things GNOME! (GTG) is a personal tasks and TODO list items
organizer for the GNOME desktop environment inspired by the Getting
Things Done (GTD) methodology. GTG is designed with flexibility,
adaptability, and ease of use in mind so it can be used as more than
just GTD software. GTG is intended to help you track everything you
need to do and need to know, from small tasks to large projects.

# Export plugin uses "pdflatex", "pdftk" and "pdfjam" tools that
# generate dependency on texlive package that is overkill for
# simple todo application. If user really needs this functionality
# then he could install this dependencies on his own. Note that
# absence of this tools is not critical - code checks if it is
# installed and suggests user to install if he wants to enable export
# plugin.
