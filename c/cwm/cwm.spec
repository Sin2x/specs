%description
cwm (calm window manager) is a window manager for X11 which contains many
features that concentrate on the efficiency and transparency of window
management, while maintaining the simplest and most pleasant aesthetic.

This package contains a Linux port of the official project, which changes the
source for the port portion but doesn't touches the original functionality
provided by the original OpenBSD's project.
