%description
Ag (silversearcher) is a code searching tool.
It is an order of magnitude faster than ack.
It ignores file patterns from .gitignore and .hgignore.
If there are files in your source repo you don't want to search,
just add their patterns to a .ignore file.
The command name is 33%% shorter than ack, and all keys are on the home row!
